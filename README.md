# MATLAB Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier

The provided report is equivalent to documentation.

- Images are GIFs, and they only have black shapes against a white background.

- The code is modular and creates a classifier from scratch; it does not use ready-made or provided functions/libraries.

# Setup and use

- Images were too many to directly upload, so they had to be zipped. Simply unzip 'images' and place the inner folder in the same directory as the code.

- Only MATLAB is required; simply download it and immediately test the code.

- Function _train()_ is the main one to run the classifier. 

- Use _test()_ to run the classifier and test it's accuracy using a confusion matrix. Additionally, the function can be used as an example of use.

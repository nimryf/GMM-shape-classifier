# MATLAB Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier

The provided report is equivalent to documentation.

- Images are GIFs, and they only have black shapes against a white background.

- The code is very modular and creates a classifier from scratch; it does not use ready-made or provided functions/libraries.

- Images were too many to directly upload, so they were zipped. Make sure to unzip them before use.

# Setup and use

- Only MATLAB is required; there are no dependencies.
